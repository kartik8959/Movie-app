 ## Steps To Setup the Project
   
- Navigate to the frontend folder and run the command ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies. If you encounter any errors, make sure to resolve them before proceeding to the next step.

- Navigate to the backend folder and run the command ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies. Again, make sure to resolve any errors before proceeding.

- Navigate to the root folder of the project and run the command ```npm install``` to install any remaining dependencies.

- Once all the dependencies have been installed successfully, you can start the development server by running the command ``` npm run dev.```

- If everything has been set up correctly, you should now be able to access the project by navigating to ```http://localhost:8000``` in your web browser.

- It's important to note that these steps assume that the project has already been set up and configured correctly.
